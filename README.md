# Solution Provider Readiness
Last update: September 2023

## This site
... is a supplementary page for OCI's showcase page of OCI-committed solution providers to provide you more details on the level of each service provider's OCI conformance. Please find the main page at [oc-i.org/marketplace](https://www.oc-i.org/marketplace).

## We do not
... display a comprehensive range of each listed service provider's commercial offering. OCI is only concerned with these companies' relationship to OCI's framework. Thus, listed providers are identified by their role within OCI's framework or, in the case of outsourcing providers, a term that aims to encompass their OCI-related offering only. **Research yourself which service provider addresses your needs best.**

>*The commercial service providers listed on this page have demonstrated that they meet [OCI’s applicable conformance criteria](https://www.oc-i.org/interoperability-profile). Proof of such adherence to OCI’s framework is provided as far as possible. OCI has not performed any further quality checks on these entities. The links are provided solely for informational purposes and convenience of our site visitors. Please refer to our [Disclaimer](https://www.oc-i.org/disclaimer).*

## Find out about service providers’ readiness 
OCI-committed service providers actively work towards or have achieved adherence to [OCI’s conformance requirements](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Conformance-Program/). 

Some service providers are ready to go! Others are preparing to test their interoperability and get OCI-conformant. Any of the service providers listed here can be **contacted directly** with inquiries about their DSCSA solutions.

### ☆ Service Interoperability
Interoperability testing is happening on an ongoing basis between service providers through small- and large-scale testing efforts.

The [Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA)](https://hda.org/) has been coordinating a large-scale testing effort between VRS providers since summer 2022. This testing program included two phases and also addressed OCI specificatons:
- Testing of GS1 Lightweight Messaging Standard v1.2 implementation.
- Testing of GS1 Lightweight Messaging Standard v1.3 implementation.
Since then other Service Providers have also cut over from v1.2 to v1.3. Note that there is no backward compatibility following this particular verion upgrade.

OCI works closely with HDA to keep this table up to date. There may be VRS providers who collaborate through HDA-facilitated events and/or are aligned with OCI specifications but are not listed here.

### ☆ Proof of OCI conformance
OCI requires **VRS providers** to submit a self-attestation asserting compliance with the [VRS Integration Conformance Criteria](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/VRS-Conformance-Criteria/). 

- Find blank OCI forms on our [main site](https://www.oc-i.org/forms).

OCI requires **Credential Issuers** and **Digital Wallet providers** to undergo a formal 3rd-party audit to assert compliance with the [Credential Issuer](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Credential-Issuer-Conformance-Criteria/) and [Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Digital-Wallet-Conformance-Criteria/latest), respectively.

See also [OCI’s conformance requirements](https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/Conformance-Program/).

### ☆ Other
Some service providers have shown commitment to the OCI framework through their contributions to this ecosystem, but have not yet participated in interoperability testing or attested OCI conformance.

Some solution providers do not need to undergo testing or conformance attestation because they outsource the needed key functions to OCI-aligned service providers through **close partnerships**.
